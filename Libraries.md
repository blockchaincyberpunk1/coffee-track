# Libraries Used in Ethereum Supply Chain DApp v1

## Introduction
In the development of the Ethereum Supply Chain DApp v1, several libraries were used to enhance functionality, security, and testing. This document highlights these libraries and discusses the reasons for their adoption.

## Libraries Overview

### 1. OpenZeppelin Contracts
- **Version**: `^5.0.1`
- **Usage**: OpenZeppelin provides secure, standard, and audited smart contract implementations, particularly for ERC standards and security features like access control and security checks.
- **Reason for Adoption**: OpenZeppelin's contracts are widely trusted in the Ethereum community. They reduce the need to write common functionality from scratch and mitigate security risks by providing tested and community-reviewed implementations.

### 2. Hardhat
- **Version**: `^2.19.2`
- **Usage**: Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum software. It facilitates tasks like testing, debugging, and deploying smart contracts.
- **Reason for Adoption**: Hardhat provides a robust environment for smart contract development. Its local Ethereum network for testing and its debugging tools are particularly beneficial for iterative development and testing.

### 3. Ethers.js
- **Version**: `^5.7.2`
- **Usage**: Ethers.js is a library to interact with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem. It provides functionality to create wallets, interact with smart contracts, and handle transactions.
- **Reason for Adoption**: Ethers.js is selected for its simplicity and wide usage in Ethereum applications. It offers a comprehensive collection of tools required for interacting with Ethereum nodes and contracts.

### 4. Chai
- **Version**: `^4.3.10`
- **Usage**: Chai is an assertion library for Node.js and the browser that can be paired with any JavaScript testing framework. It is used for writing test cases.
- **Reason for Adoption**: Chai is chosen for its fluent and readable syntax, making test cases easier to write and understand. It integrates well with Hardhat and other testing frameworks used in the project.

### 5. Hardhat Waffle
- **Version**: `^2.0.6`
- **Usage**: Hardhat Waffle is a Hardhat plugin for using Waffle, a framework for testing Ethereum smart contracts, within a Hardhat project.
- **Reason for Adoption**: It provides a seamless integration of Waffle's robust testing capabilities with Hardhat's development environment, enhancing the testing process for smart contracts.

### 6. Hardhat Gas Reporter
- **Version**: `^1.0.9`
- **Usage**: This plugin generates a gas report for Ethereum tests, showing gas usage per unit test and providing insights into contract efficiency.
- **Reason for Adoption**: Understanding and optimizing gas consumption is crucial in Ethereum development. This tool aids in identifying high-cost functions and optimizing smart contract efficiency.

### 7. dotenv
- **Version**: `^16.3.1`
- **Usage**: Dotenv is a module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- **Reason for Adoption**: This library is used to manage sensitive information, such as private keys and API keys, keeping them secure and separate from the codebase.

### 8. Solidity Coverage
- **Version**: `^0.8.5`
- **Usage**: A tool for measuring smart contract code coverage to ensure thorough testing.
- **Reason for Adoption**: Solidity Coverage provides valuable insights into which parts of the contract code are covered by tests, helping to identify areas lacking sufficient test coverage.

## Conclusion
The adoption of these libraries has significantly contributed to the security, efficiency, and reliability of the Ethereum Supply Chain DApp v1. They provide a solid foundation for smart contract development and deployment, ensuring best practices in coding, testing, and security.
