# Smart Contract Architecture

## Introduction
This document outlines the architecture of smart contracts developed for a blockchain-based supply chain management system. The system tracks the lifecycle of coffee products from production to consumption.

## Architecture Overview

### Modular Design
The system is designed with a modular approach, separating concerns into individual contracts for clarity, security, and reusability.

### Contracts

#### Access Control Layer
- **Owned.sol**: Defines contract ownership and controls access to certain functions.
- **Roles.sol**: A library for managing different roles within the system.
- **Role-Based Contracts**:
  - **ConsumerRole.sol**: Manages the consumer role.
  - **DistributorRole.sol**: Manages the distributor role.
  - **FarmerRole.sol**: Manages the farmer role.
  - **RetailerRole.sol**: Manages the retailer role.

#### Core Layer
- **SupplyChain.sol**:
  - **Purpose**: Acts as the central contract encapsulating the core logic of the supply chain.
  - **Key Components**:
    - Item tracking and state management.
    - Interaction with role-based contracts.
    - Implementation of supply chain actions (harvesting, processing, packing, etc.).
    - Event emission for state transitions.

#### Extension Layer
- **Ownable.sol**:
  - **Purpose**: Extends the `SupplyChain` contract with ownership functionalities.
  - **Features**: Ownership transfer, renouncement, and checks.

## Design Patterns

### Role-Based Access Control
Ensures that interactions with the supply chain are carried out by authenticated participants.

### State Machine
Manages the lifecycle of each product in the supply chain through enumerated states.

### Circuit Breaker
Provides an emergency stop mechanism for critical functions in the event of unforeseen issues.

### Modifiers
Used extensively for validating conditions before function execution, enhancing security and reducing code redundancy.

## Security Considerations

### Reentrancy Guard
Prevents reentrancy attacks by ensuring certain functions cannot be called while they are already executing.

### Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern
Used to mitigate potential issues related to state changes and external calls.

### Access Restriction
Critical functions are restricted to specific roles or the owner, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

### Gas Limitation
Functions are designed to consume a reasonable amount of gas, preventing out-of-gas errors and potential DoS attacks.

## Deployment and Interaction

### Deployment Script (`deploy.js`)
Automates the deployment of contracts, specifically the `Ownable` contract as an entry point.

### Hardhat Configuration (`hardhat.config.js`)
Configures the development environment, including compiler settings, network configurations, and gas reporting.

### Interaction
The contracts are designed to interact seamlessly, ensuring data integrity and consistent state transitions across the supply chain.

## Conclusion
The smart contract system for the supply chain application exemplifies a robust, secure, and modular design. It leverages Ethereum's blockchain technology to bring transparency, efficiency, and trust to the coffee product lifecycle.
